# Description
HelpingOut was created to help connecting people who want to help their local communities, with local foodbank and blood drive organizations that need their help. Whether the user wants to become a blood donor or volunteer for food banks and other organizations in their area, we want to help make it easier for them to do it.<br />
When the user accesses HelpingOut, they will be asked if they would rather contribute by donating money, donating food and blood or volunteering their time. They will then be asked for their zip code. After they finish inputting their criteria, they will be presented with a list of the foodbanks within their areas that are accepting donations and volunteers.

# User Story
GIVEN that I want to find a location near me where I can donate food, blood or become a volunteer.<br />
I WANT to see names and addresses of hospitals/organizations and be able to save my favorite locations.<br />
SO THAT I can help someone in my neighborhood and come back to the website and easily find these places in the future.<br />


# Functionality
WHEN I open the App<br />
THEN I am given a list of options to choose how can I help today<br />
WHEN I select a button I am able to enter my zip code and get results<br />
THROUGH APIs and features that print out names of organizations who need volunteers. <br />
