# Project-1-Helping-Out

Live at: https://joelstraley.github.io/Project-1-Helping-Out/


# Description:
In this project we intend to build an app that helps connect people who want to help their local communities, with local foodbank and blood drive organizations that need their help. Whether the user wants to volunteer time, money, or direct resources to the food banks in their area, we want to help make it easier for them to do it.

When the user accesses the app, they will be asked if they would rather contribute by donating money, donating food and blood or volunteering their time. They will then be asked for their zip code and travel radius. After they finish inputting their criteria, they will be presented with a list of the foodbanks within their areas that are accepting donations and volunteers.
